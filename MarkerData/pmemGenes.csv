The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO2 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO3, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots, in vascular system of cotyledons and young leaves,and in fruit abscission zone; it was not expressed in anthers and pollen, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s). mlo resistance in A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene, jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin, glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter.",plasma membrane

ATMLO8 belongs to the clade III, with AtMLO5, AtMLO7, AtMLO9, and AtMLO10. The gene is expressed during seedling growth, in cotyledons and hypocotyl, and in fruit abscission zone, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).",plasma membrane

PHOT1 undergoes blue-light-dependent autophosphorylation. At least eight phosphorylation sites have been identified in PHOT1. Phosphorylation of serine851 in the activation loop of PHOT1 appears to be required for stomatal opening, chloroplast accumulation, leaf flattening, and phototropism, and phosphorylation of serine849 may also contribute to the regulation of these responses.

AT5G65700.1,"Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function. Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.",plasma membrane
