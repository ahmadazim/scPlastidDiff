Mediates blue light-induced growth enhancements. PHOT1 and PHOT2 mediate blue light-dependent activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in guard cell protoplasts. PHOT2 possesses two LOV (LOV1 and LOV2, for light-oxygen-voltage-sensing) domains involved in FMN-binding and a C-terminus forming a serine/threonine kinase domain. LOV2 acts as an inhibitor of phototropin kinase in the dark, and light cancels the inhibition through cysteine-FMN adduct formation. LOV1 in contrast acts as an attenuator of photoactivation.
