AT5G58220.1,transthyretin-like protein,peroxisome
AT5G58220.2,"Encodes a transthyretin-like S-allantoin synthase protein that catalyzes two steps in the allantoin biosynthesis pathway by acting as a hydroxyisourate hydrolase and a 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline (OHCU) decarboxylase. Two alternatively spliced versions of the transcript give rise to a longer peroxisomally-targeted protein (AT5G58220.1 (called TTL1-)) and a slightly shorter cytoplasmic protein (AT5G58220.3 (called TTL2-)). Both have roughly equivalent enzymatic activity in vitro, but, allantoin biosynthesis is believed to occur in the peroxisome suggesting that the cytosolic form may participate in a different process.",peroxisome
